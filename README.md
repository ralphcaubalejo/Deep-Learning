Classifying Condominiums having High and Low Price/Area Value using Google Street Images

## Introduction

Many Real Estate companies has been on the rise like SMDC, EPMC, Cityland and many more Real Estate Players. Lot of Big Companies are also making their own property management group so that they can have a market share on real estate boom. With this at hand, it would be beneficial if we can have Deep Learning model that can predict the Condominium Prices just based on the Images from its surrounding environment like roads,malls and the likes.

## Problem

Can we classify Condominium/Condominium Building if they have a High or Low Price/Area Value using Images from its surrounding?

## Methodology

## Dataset

The Dataset involves diffent pictures scraped from Google Earth/Google Street Maps. 

A Sample are as follows:

## Results

Based on the results of the Fitting of the model, first we can see that the accuracies of each of the models is not that high. The maximum accuracy can be seen already on the VGG16 Models which is around 67% which above the 1.25 PCC Score which is around 62.5.
